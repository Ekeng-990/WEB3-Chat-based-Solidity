# 🌐 Decentralized Chat App

A serverless Web3-based chat app where messages are stored directly on the blockchain, ensuring immutability.

## ✨ Features
- **Serverless** – All messages are stored on the blockchain.
- **Secure & Transparent** – Messages cannot be deleted or altered.
- **Metamask Integration** – Easy login with a Web3 wallet.
- **Blockchain Technology** – Built with Solidity & Ethers.js.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Solidity** – Smart contract for storing messages.

- **Metamask** – Seamless authentication without servers.
- **HTML, CSS, JS** – Simple yet modern UI.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Deploy the Smart Contract** on a testnet (Sepolia/Mumbai).
2. **Edit `script.js`** and update the contract address.
3. **Open `index.html`** in a browser and connect Metamask.
4. **Start chatting!** Messages are instantly stored on the blockchain.

## 📌 Notes
